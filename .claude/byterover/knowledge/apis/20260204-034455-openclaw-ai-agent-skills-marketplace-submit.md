- OpenClaw skills can be submitted to the OpenClaw Skill marketplace (openclawskill.ai), which allows developers to publish and version AI skill bundles.
- Skills are typically created as markdown files with YAML frontmatter and instructions in a SKILL.md file within a skill directory.
- Skills can be installed using command line tools like `npx openclawskill install <skill-name>`.
- There are security concerns with the marketplace, as researchers have found hundreds of malicious skills, so careful vetting is recommended.
- Alternatively, skills can be submitted to community collections like the GitHub repository "awesome-openclaw-skills" for wider distribution.
