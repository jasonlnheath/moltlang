# 🏆 Community Naming Contest: Help Us Name This AI Language!

## Context

Just like "OpenClaw" was chosen from hundreds of community proposals, **we want YOU to name this AI-optimized language for agent-to-agent communication.**

## What We're Building

A language **by LLMs, for LLMs** that:
- Reduces token count by 50-70% for common AI operations
- Enables efficient agent-to-agent communication
- Provides bidirectional translation with human languages
- Optimizes transformer architecture performance

## Example Translation

**English:** "Fetch data from the API using authentication"
**MoltLang:** `[OP:fetch][SRC:api][PARAM:auth]`
**Efficiency:** 70% token reduction

## Contest Rules
